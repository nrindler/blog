<p>I had the opportunity to present on “Communicating Results in R” at the weekly <strong><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Thanh-Pho-Ho-Chi-Minh-Python-Meetup/">Python Saigon Meetup</a></strong>, on Feb 25, 2017 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</p>
<p>We had a great discussion and shared data visualization tools and techniques.</p>
<p>Materials are available on <strong><a href="https://github.com/nrindler/saigon-meetup">my GitHub</a></strong>, including a <strong><a href="/post/meetup.html">RPres slide deck</a></strong> with links and resources for learning R and data visualization.</p>
